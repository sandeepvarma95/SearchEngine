Yield 6 servings Prep time 20 minutes Ingredients 1 large onion (red, cut into 1 inch pieces) 2 medium squashes (green, cut into 3/4 inch thick rounds) 1 medium squash (yellow, cut into 3/4 inch thick rounds) 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes 2 tablespoons basil (fresh, cut into ribbons [about 6 leaves]) 2 tablespoons oregano (fresh, finely chopped [about 6 sprigs]) 2 1/2 teaspoons salt 5 cloves black pepper 2 tablespoons garlic (finely chopped) 4 tablespoons red wine vinegar lemon juice (1 whole lemon) 1/4 cup olive oil Notes If you do not have a grill, these kabobs can easily be roasted in a pre-heated oven at 400°F for 15 minutes. Equipment Needed: Measuring cups and spoons, whisk, medium bowl, 1 gallon freezer bag, kabob skewers, marinade brush, grill or grill pan (optional) Steps In a medium bowl, whisk together garlic, herbs, lemon, salt, black pepper, red wine vinegar and olive oil to create a marinade. Place onions, yellow squash, green squash and tomatoes in a 1 gallon freezer bag. Pour marinade in bag and shake until all vegetables are coated. Let sit for at least 1 hour. Vegetables can marinate for up to 24 hours, in refrigerator, if you prefer to prep ahead. After vegetables are done marinating, prepare skewers starting with green squash flesh side out, then onion, tomato, yellow squash, onion, tomato, and finish with green squash. Place constructed kabobs on a hot grill and cook for about 7 minutes on each side brushing every few minutes with marinade until cooked through. The squash will be tender and the onions will have a slight char on the edges. Serve on the skewers or off the skewer. Enjoy on any summer night.
